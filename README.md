# Smart-mirror-software-in-python
A graphical interface for a smart mirror in python with Raspberry Pi 4, Raspberry Pi camera module and PIR senzor module.
Software require: a linux image for rapsberry pi (in my case I use Raspbian Pi OS) and python 3.8.6 in my case.
After you install manually all dependecies with pip install (I don't have a file to install them automatically) you must complete all data in smart_mirror.py file, which is the main file.
